Scope:		Problem 4: Write a program that asks the user to input:
	    	The number of gallons of gas in the tank
   			The fuel efficiency in miles per gallon
			The price of gas per gallon
			Then print the cost per 100 miles and how far the car can go with the gas in the car..  
Algorithm:	1) prompt the user for gallons of gas in the car / allow fractions
			2) capture the return value in inTheTank type = float
			3) proment the user for mpg / allow whole number only 
			4) capture the returned value in mpg type = int
			5) prompt the user for price of gas / allow fractions
			6) capture the returned value in gasPrice type = float
			7) output: "With gass at $" + gasPrice + " per gallon, going 100 miles will cost you $" + (gasPrice * 100)
			8) output: "Since your car's efficiency is " + mpg + " mpg and given that you have " +  inTheTank + " gallons in the tank, by my calculations you can go " + (int)(mpg * inTheTank) + " miles before you run out of gas."
